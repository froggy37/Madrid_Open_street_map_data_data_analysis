# Madrid_Open_street_map_data_data_analysis
MongoDB data analysis of Madrid city data

This project consisted of analysing an xml file donwloaded from the open street map data of the city of Madrid. The link to this file
can be found in link.txt. The xml was analysed, it was cleaned of errors, standardised and converted into a JSON file.
This JSON file was then imported into MongoDB, and queries were run in the database to obtain analysis and information such as
what is the most popular cuisine in Madrid. The audit.py program checked the data for possible errors. The clean.py programm cleaned
the data and shaped it into a JSON file. The query.py program compiled the queries to run in mongo. 

Details of the project can be found in the Project pdf file. Also a sample of the xml is provided (sample.osm)
